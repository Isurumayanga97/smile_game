# Smile Game

Writing a game to select the number corresponding to the blank in mathematical equations requires careful consideration of time constraints. The player must be able to quickly identify and select the most suitable number while still adhering to any rules or limitations set by the game. It is important for players of all levels, from novice learners up through experienced mathematicians, that they are given enough time within each equation so as not to feel rushed or overwhelmed when trying out different solutions.
